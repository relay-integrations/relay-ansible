# playbook-run

This step runs an Ansible [Playbook](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_intro.html).

Ansible also exposes many configuration settings that may not be present in the spec for this step using environment variables, which can be configured in Relay using the `env` key of a step definition. See the [Ansible reference documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/config.html) for a list of available settings.
